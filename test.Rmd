### Summary

The decarbonization of energy sources to mitigate climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today. There is significant pressure to achieve the increasingly prevalent, highly ambitious clean energy goals. Even where physical conditions are well suited for renewable energy, there is often significant variation in their potential and use (Pierce et al., 2021). Limited knowledge exists pertaining to the determining factors for successful siting of wind and solar energy projects. Without understanding the relationships between renewable energy development and local or regional siting criteria, clean energy policies could result in unintended consequences or end up being less effective (Wu et al., 2020). Grace Wu (the Client) previously piloted a study that predicted energy siting locations in the western United States. The objective of this capstone project is to expand on this previous work and determine the most influential factors for successful siting of utility-scale onshore wind and solar photovoltaics for the continental United States (US) by:  

1. Identify and analyze the relationship of renewable energy siting with physical, societal, technology, and policy factors.  
2. Generate prediction maps of future siting of wind and solar power plants using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms.   

To achieve these objectives the team used four processing steps: data gathering and management, creation of a complete raster stack, machine learning analysis, and siting predictions map generation. Gathered geospatial data for every environmental variable used in the analysis was rasterized to perform the machine learning analysis to determine the relationship of renewable energy with physical, societal, technology, and policy factors.  

Data is stored on the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management server, named Taylor, and code is documented on the energy-siting GitHub repository. The team primarily used R for writing and producing code with some Python used in the data gathering process. To make certain calculations faster, QGIS was used to calculate euclidean distances. Any areas where QGIS was used are fully documented with details on the decision to use the software and what functions were performed. Data, code, and analysis will be tested thoroughly to ensure that full functionality is achieved.   

The team achieved a national analysis for determining the most influential factors for successful siting of renewable energy projects. Based on these factors a map was generated using machine learning processes that contain the predicted locations of future projects. The team used multiple methods of machine learning that will be discussed further in the User Documentation section.

### Problem Statement

Climate change is a growing threat and one of the ways we can mitigate the impacts is through rapid decarbonization of energy sources (Wu et al. 2020). Renewable energy provides a technologically proven pathway to reach decarbonization goals. Limited knowledge exists pertaining to the determining factors for successful siting of utility scale onshore wind and solar photovoltaic energy projects. Identifying the most influential determinants of renewable energy siting would inform better electricity system planning, better use of limited resources in successful siting of future power plants, and allow for a more rapid decarbonization of energy sources.

### Specific Objectives

The objective of this project is to fill this knowledge gap by determining the most influential factors for the successful siting of renewable energy projects for each region in the US by:  

1. Identify and analyze the relationship of renewable energy siting with physical, societal, technology, and policy factors.  
2. Generate prediction maps of future siting of wind and solar power plants using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms.

### Testing

Testing Code:  
The scripts used in the project were checked for reproducibility across different operating systems (OS). This includes functions that check for the presence of packages and install them if they are not present on the userâ€™s machine. At each step of data curation and combination throughout the project, students performed unit testing on intermediate outputs to ensure the data was combined in correct formats allowing for proper functionality. Code review was performed by the team members to ensure the access to code and documentation is preserved after the project.   


Testing Data:  
Reviews will be conducted as data is downloaded and used to validate that data aligns with the provided metadata and can guide the analysis as is intended. Data types and structures will be tested using the implementation of error messages throughout the code for future users of the algorithm to validate that calculations are being performed on the correct data types. Students will perform a percent presence/absence of raster cells to ensure there is enough data being used in the regression to avoid errors due to row wise deletion. Any changes made to the datasets to handle missingness will be added to the metadata documentation. There will also be a built-in test telling users how many observations will be used in a regression to ensure that users are aware of list wise deletion possibilities.   


Testing Algorithms & Analyses:   
Regressions will be checked to ensure that the respective assumptions are satisfied. We will also test for multicollinearity through examination of the correlation coefficients and their variance inflation factor (VIF) values. We will conduct sanity checks on our machine learning model output to ensure that siting predictions are feasible. For example, predicted locations should not include bodies of water or other excluded areas. The machine learning models will be tested using the metrics of the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve and the Area Under the Curve (ROC/AUC).  


Testing Product Performance:    
If the RShiny stretch goal is achieved, it will be tested thoroughly to ensure that full functionality is achieved.
